# ACM-AI-Applied-Track

This repository contains the Colab Notebooks I completed in the ACM AI, a subbranch of UCLA's student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Specifically, these projects were a part of ACM AI's applied track, which covered PyTorch, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.

## Project Overviews

### Neural Networks with MNIST

This project involves digit classification with the MNIST dataset. This project applied a typical neural network architecture with multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent. After training, the model attained over 90% accuracy on the test dataset.

### CNNs with CIFAR-10

This project sought to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories. Building upon previous ideas regarding neural networks obtained through the MNIST notebook, this project introduces convolutional neural networks. The convolutional neural network consisted of multiple convolutional layers followed by a hidden fully connected neural network. Techniques such as max pooling, flattening, and dropout were also used to increase performance. The model achieved an accuracy above 70% on the test dataset.
